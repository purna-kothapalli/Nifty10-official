                <p className="privacy-text">Every stock has a <span class="bold">pre-assigned point</span> . The <span class="bold">Big Bull </span> & <span class="bold">Big Bear </span>  Multiplier plays a crucial role in boosting your final score.</p>
                <ul className='privacy--list'>
                    <li className='privacy-list-item'>If the Selected <span class="bold">Big Bull </span>(best performer) in the <span className="Bullish-text">Bullish</span> market trend is one of the <span class="bold">top performers</span> of the day, the points will be <span class="bold">multiplied by</span> <span class="bold">10X</span>.</li>

                    Additionally, the user selected M&M as the <span class="bold">Big Bull </span>, and since it was one of the top-performing stocks, its points will be <span class="bold">multiplied by</span> <span class="bold">10X</span>.
